        <h1>User Crud</h1>
        <p>This project was completed as part of the coding challenge for the <a href="https://www.codefellows.org/development-accelerators/">Code Fellows Python Development Accelerator</a> in order to show a basic familiarity with Django development.</p>
        <p>Deployed on Heroku, the  app allows visitors to create, read, update, and destroy users stored in a Postgres database. Additionally, select users can be protected from casual deletions or modifications through the admin panel.</p>
        <p>There also may be a few easter eggs included--just for fun.</p>
